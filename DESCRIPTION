Description: The current version of this package estimates spatial autoregressive models for binary dependent variables using GMM estimators. It supports one- and 
  two-steps GMM estimator along with the linearized GMM estimator proposed by Klier and McMillen (2008). It also allows for either Probit or Logit model.
